For this assignment, I used Jyputer. There is 1 Jupyter notebook.

The Jyputer notebook is located at the following URL:

https://github.com/LamyaDaakir/CS7641_Assignment4

To run the code, download the file into a directory and execute the 'jupyter notebook' or 'jupyter lab' command.
Open the appropriate notebook and run the cells starting from the top.
